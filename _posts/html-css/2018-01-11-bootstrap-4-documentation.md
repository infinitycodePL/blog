Bootstrap helps me to build a beautiful landing and one-page sites. And I believe is not true that every Bootstrap site looks the same! Usually, the good site looks as good as is a need or occasionally how skillful are developers whose built it.

Bootstrap helping me to fast building nice looking and responsive site. The framework includes a lot of ready to use it styles. This is a very powerful tool and I really enjoy to work on Bootstrap projects.
