Sass is a CSS preprocessor that extends CSS functionality by adding certain features that arenâ€™t available in CSS. The main features that are included in Sass are variables, nesting, partials, imports, mixins, inheritance, and operators.

In short, using SASS save a lot of my time. My code is more readable but also fully modular. It means I am able to import blocks of my code straight across many of my projects. I love to use SASS in my project from the first time I adopted! 

For me, a good and understandable organization speed my performance and improve the quality of my outcome. Whenever I start a new project, the article helps me to build a good folder structure for my SASS files.
