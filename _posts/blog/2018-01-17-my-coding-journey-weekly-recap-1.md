- I watch a great [Harvard Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y62zj9ozPOM&list=PLhQjrBD2T3828ZVcVzEIhsHVgjANGZveu). The professor is incredibly charismatic and extremely good at making the complicated easy to understand. The course is 12 lectures of 1-2 hours each. So far watched 5 episodes and I highly recommend it anyone! 


#### My plan for the following week is

- Doing SEO works for my local client.
- Creating 2 modular landing pages in Bootstrap and SASS.
- Completing next [jQuery course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a59kOE2Ma1Q&list=PL6n9fhu94yhVDV697uvHpavA3K_eWGQap). Currently, I've done 20/113.
- Completing [PHP course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL442FA2C127377F07) - Well, maybe this is not the best of the best PHP course, but I really like the convention of 6 minutes short videos. I usually watch this in my free time, during I walk etc. The PHP it seems to be easy, and watching this helps me when I need to use it. Currently, I've done 70/200.
- Watching a few more episodes from [Cs50 Harvard Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y62zj9ozPOM&list=PLhQjrBD2T3828ZVcVzEIhsHVgjANGZveu).
- Continuing my activity on Udacity Challenge Scholarship forum.

#### The other things:


My biggest ill at this moment is that I want to start a freelance business and me not sure how to start it. I know that exists a lot of sites like freelancer.com but I noticed that a lot offers is compete with based on low price mostly. Not the quality of the services.

What is our best advice on how to start freelance service? Do you have any advice for me?

Stay tuned!
