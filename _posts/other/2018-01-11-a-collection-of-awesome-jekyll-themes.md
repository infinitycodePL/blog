>Gem-packaged themes are just an advanced option and in addition they are in development for (real world) experiments (e.g. think v0.1 as stated by the Ben Balter - the lead designer / manager / dev at GitHub).

>Thus, to conclude do NOT read too much into the official themes docs e.g. as the only or "right" way to design a theme. Just (continue to) use "classic" themes - there are hundreds to learn from and once you have mastered "classic" themes you can "graduate" to the master class, that is, using gem-packaged themes.
