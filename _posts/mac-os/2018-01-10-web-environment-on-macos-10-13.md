The 3 part tutorial in which Andy Miller walkthrough setting up and configuring Apache 2.4, multiple PHP versions, MySQL, Apache virtual hosts, APC and Xdebug.

In my opinion, this is an awesome setup. I have an access to all tools directly from my command line. Everything works smooth, fast and simple. Every day I enjoy my mac with the environment.
