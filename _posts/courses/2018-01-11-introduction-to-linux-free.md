Knowing Linux is an edge in web development since most tools such as Apache, MySQL, PHP, SVN, and SSH were created for Linux. A developer thoroughly understands the environment the program runs and most servers run some kind of Linux/Unix.Furthermore, nowadays Linux is everywhere. In your phone, on your tv, and in your fridge ;)

I walk through a few Linux lessons from different sources, but this one looks the most solid and comprehensive. I haven't finished the course yet so I update my review later.
