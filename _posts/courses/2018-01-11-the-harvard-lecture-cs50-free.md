If you are a newbie to programming I highly recommend you to take it. It starts from the very basics and advances gradually to the higher level, while teaching you about almost every aspect of Computer Science. The lectures are incredibly well packed with information. Above all it will motivate you by introducing you to gaming, cryptography, web development and security, etc.

I think cs50 is a great place for beginners to jump right in. No prerequisites required!
